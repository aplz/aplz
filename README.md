### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I received my PhD in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing from the [University of Bonn](https://mlai.cs.uni-bonn.de/) and [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html) where I was member of the former Text Mining group. Now I work on AI and data driven products, mostly focused on applications in the medical and healthcare domain. My main passion is NLP, especially for the German language, and Information Retrieval (IR).
